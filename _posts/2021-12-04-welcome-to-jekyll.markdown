# Welcome to My Minimal GitHub Website

This is my first post on my new minimal GitHub website. I'm excited to share my thoughts and projects here!

## What to expect

- Updates on my latest projects
- Insights into my learning journey
- Interesting findings and resources

```ruby 
    def print_hi(name)
        puts "Hi, #{name}"
    end
    print_hi('Tom')
    #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
